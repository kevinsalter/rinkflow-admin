Before we continue I want you to be completely blunt and honest -- are we:

1. keeping things as simple as possible
2. respecting the goals of our MVP
3. focused on leveraging the full capabilities of libraries we already are using in this project (especially looking at React Native SVG), and not reinventing the wheel in any regard
