# Product Requirements Document: Phase 2 - Fast Follows

## Introduction/Overview

Phase 2 builds upon the Phase 1 foundation by adding enhancements and features that improve the admin portal experience. This phase focuses on authentication improvements, notification systems, and additional administrative capabilities that weren't critical for the initial MVP but provide significant value to organization administrators.

## Goals

1. Enhance authentication with social sign-in options
2. Implement email notification system for important events
3. Add real-time collaboration features for multiple admins
4. Provide advanced reporting and custom analytics
5. Enable white-label customization options
6. Integrate third-party services via webhooks
7. Implement granular permission system

## User Stories

1. **As an organization admin**, I want to log in using Google OAuth so that I can access the admin portal more conveniently without managing another password.

2. **As an organization admin**, I want to switch between multiple organizations I belong to so that I can manage different teams from one account.

3. **As an organization admin**, I want to receive email notifications about important events so that I stay informed even when not actively using the portal.

4. **As an organization admin**, I want to see real-time updates when other admins make changes so that we can collaborate effectively.

5. **As an organization admin**, I want to create custom reports so that I can analyze data specific to my organization's needs.
